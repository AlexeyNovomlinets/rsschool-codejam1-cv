			<hr/>
			<p>I'm a junior software developer. I have an experience in imposition, design processing by scripts, testing,
			and working on CMS-systems. But I want to improve my technical skills with help of your courses and
			start my professional way in EPAM. And I guess I'm rather motivated, easily trained person with enough
			knowledges and abilities to get it successfully.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>My primary goal is to apply my technical expertise
			all throughout the full software life cycle to ensure production and delivery of products and services
			that meet client specifications. Along with a competent software developing team, and with personal
			baggage in software engineering and great desire, I am positive that this goal can be achieved.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>One of my objectives is to keep updated with the latest IT trends and technologies.
			I am confident that if given the opportunity, I can be a useful talent to EPAM.</p>
